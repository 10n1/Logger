Logger for Riot (prototype)

Inspired by this post on #AltDevBlogADay: altdevblogaday.com/2012/01/23/writing-your-own-websocket-server/

The idea is to create a web interface command center for Riot. This is the intended roadmap for the Logger:

* [DONE] Create proof of concept project composed of a C++ application communication with a web page and successfully complete the WebSocket handshake
* Send text messages from the native C++ app to the webpage
* Send text messages from the webpage to the native C++ app
* Switch from passing text to passing JSON
* Integrate into Riot :)

=Instructions (have only tested this locally but should work over the network)
* Serve Logger/Logger/RiotLog.html using a web server...easiest thing to do is to install python and run the following command in the html directory:
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
* Open Chrome to localhost:8000/RiotLog.html
* Open the Logger.sln
* Build/run Logger
* Back in RiotLog.html, enter IP address and port and hit connect
* should work??? if it works you'll see connected in green font in the "Riot Log" on the webpage...if it doesn't work then you'll see something about key mismatch in the Chrom dev tools (Ctrl + Shift + J on Windows or Command + Option + J on Mac)
