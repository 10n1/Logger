Logger for Riot (prototype)

Inspired by this post on #AltDevBlogADay: altdevblogaday.com/2012/01/23/writing-your-own-websocket-server/

The idea is to create a web interface command center for Riot. This is the intended roadmap for the Logger:

* [DONE] Create proof of concept project composed of a C++ application communication with a web page and successfully complete the WebSocket handshake
* Send text messages from the native C++ app to the webpage
* Send text messages from the webpage to the native C++ app
* Switch from passing text to passing JSON
* Integrate into Riot :)
